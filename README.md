# GAPR
A Genetic Algorithm for Polynomial Regression created as a final project for a Computer Science 2 course.
The program uses 4 different genetic algorithms to find solutions using an R^2 value as fitness.


## Format
Place all data points in 'points.csv'
Compile and run 'Controller.java' then input the highest degree polynomial

NOTE: If the GA can't find a solution with a fitness value of 1.0, the closest solution will be posted after 500,000 cycles.
